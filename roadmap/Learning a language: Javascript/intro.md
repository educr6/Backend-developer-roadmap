# Learn a language : Javascript

Javascript is a force that a software engineer can't just overlook. At the time of this writing, I dont know a programming language that has a stronger community and that can do so many things: Web, Mobile, Desktop, Embedded, ML , you name it. I feel like reasons to learn javascript and its ecosystem are not too necesarry to explain, so I will focus on the path that I will follow:

- Javascript, understanding the weird parts, from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/)
- The Full JavaScript & ES6 Tutorai, from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/es6-in-depth/)
- Learn and Understand NodeJS, from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-nodejs/)

My reasoning behind choosing these 3 courses is the following: One course to understand the syntax and how it runs, another course to keep up with the latest standard and way of writing javascript, and a third one to understand the backend side of things, from the beginning.

Alongside the courses, I will practice data structures and algorithms using js.
