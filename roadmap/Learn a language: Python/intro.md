# Learn a language : Python

I begin this step of the roadmap by saying that Python is one of the languages that I picked for the following reasons:  
- It is a programming language used in different fields: Web Development, Data science , ML , Scripting
- At the moment of these words being written, it is the language that I feel most comfortable with
- My current engineering degree's project uses python, so knowledge could be applied inmediately
- Second most popular programming language according to stack overflow survey 2020, and a high demmand of developers who create solutions around python and its stack

I have previously developed scripts, test suites and backend applications with python, so my approach with this step of the roadmap is to not redo a beginners guide. Instead, I will be studying and practicing from the following sources:  
- Fluent Python , O'reilly
- Advanced REST APIs with Flask and Python , from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-rest-apis-flask-python/)

From Fluent Python I'll be learlning the data model andn structures of the language, control flow, metaprogramming, best practices and language-specific features. From the Udemy Course I'll be learning more web development using python.
