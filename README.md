# Backend-developer-roadmap Journey!

## Welcome to my Backend-developer-roadmap repository

This repository contains all the files gathered and/or created during my journey on one of the roadmaps made by [roadmap.sh](roadmap.sh)  
I've made the repository public for visibility purposes and for the element of accountability.  

&nbsp;

### Background
At the moment of beginning this roadmap, Im:
- 22 years old
- Software Engineering Student (Senior Year) working on my final project
- Software developer with 1 year of experience, splitted between education and banking industries
- Comfortable with Python/C# scripts / web applications
- Being eaten alive by Impostor Syndrome  

&nbsp;

### What are my goals with this repository
This repository is part of a bigger evolution in my software engineering Career. Even though Im 6 months away from my graduation, and almost 2 years into working as a paid Software Developer, I felt like I needed to take a step back, analyze myself and identify what are my strengths, my weaknesses and what I needed in order to make the next jump in my career.  
I'll be going through a Dragon Ball styled Time Chamber training, where I'll come out with the following accomplishments:
- This roadmap completed (with demonstrative material)
- A Learn In Public Board (inspired by [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/learn/))
- One contribution to an open source project (HacktoberFest is right around the corner, so maybe I'll be doing more)
- One software project running live
- (Maybe) one blog post written, about anytthing (I say maybe because I have a love/hate relationship with blogposts within the Developers Community)
- Anything else I see fit during the process  
&nbsp;

Without further ado , thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore the repository!
