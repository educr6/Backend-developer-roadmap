How the internet works + DNS and how they work

Domain names:

Key points
- The internet is an infrastructure, whereas the web is a service built on top of the internet.
- DNS are servers which translates IP addresses to human-readable names , like 173.34.231.24 to thisisanexample.com
- Hosting is the computer and network infrastructure where your web applications are made available to be accessed.
- Cloud hosting is the type of hosting of most interest by cloud native development (which I like). DigitalOcean is a great example of one cloud hosting service
- HTTP has status codes, headers, payloads, connection status, can different file types (with HTTP 1.x)
- HTTPS is HTTP secured, with encryption in the form of certificates. HTTPS uses SSL and TSL (industry-standard)
- HTTPS unlocks features like service workers
- HTTP 2 main feature is multiplexing, which allows the use of only 1 connection to send muliple requests, insted of opening a connection for each.
